A simple test to practise my html and css (with a little javascript too).

A page containing a recipe that would be part of a larger cooking site.

I used a recipe from Just One Cookbook and attempted to recreate their styling with a few of my own changes thrown in to practise a few different things.

Original recipe: https://www.justonecookbook.com/kabocha-pork-stir-fry/
